# mssql-scripter 0.1

We're excited to introduce mssql-scripter, a multi-platform command line experience for scripting SQL Server databases.

## Installation

Currently, we only support installation by building and installing from a local pip installation package.  First, 
[Configuring Your Machine](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-xplat-cli/blob/dev/doc/configuring_your_machine.md), and then 
run through the [Testing local install](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-xplat-cli/blob/dev/doc/testing_local_install.md) instructions.

## Usage

For usage and help content, pass in the `-h` parameter, for example:

```bash
$ mssql-scripter -h
```
Here are a example commands that run against the AdventureWorks database:

```bash
# script the database schema to stdout
$ mssql-scripter -S localhost -d AdventureWorks -U sa 

# script the database schema and data to a file
$ mssql-scripter -S localhost -d AdventureWorks -U sa --schema-and-data  > ./adventureworks.sql

# script the database schema and data to a stdout
$ mssql-scripter -S localhost -d AdventureWorks -U sa --include-objects Employee

# script the dbo schema to a file
$ mssql-scripter -S localhost -d AdventureWorks -U sa --include-objects dbo. > ./dboschema.sql 

```
